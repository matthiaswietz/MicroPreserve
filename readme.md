## Impact of preservation and long-term storage for ribosomal metabarcoding of marine microbial communities: implications for remote autonomous sampling  

This repo describes the amplicon-seq workflow from Metfies et al. (url). We herein assessed critical steps in remote, automated microbial observation: the preservation and extraction of samples after prolonged storage to generate microbial diversity information. The project comes from the Molecular Observatory within the LTER FRAM / HAUSGARTEN, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (https://www.awi.de/en/expedition/observatories/ocean-fram.html).
